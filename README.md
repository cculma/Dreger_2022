This repository contains data of alfalfa quality Norberg population.
Dreger's thesis: analysis of correlation between FD and quality traits collected Norberg population. Alfalfa population consist of seven genotypes with six different FD clases:

|    gen    | 44 | 61 | 104 | 112 | 144 | 201 | 202 |
|:---------:|:--:|:--:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|     FD    |  4 |  6 |  5  |  1  |  3  |  2  |  3  |
| ID_2018_1 |  1 |  1 |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
| ID_2018_1 |  1 |  1 |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
| ID_2018_3 |  1 |  1 |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |

Because the augmented design experiment, we were expecting 11 measurements in 201 and 201 by env (loc:yeat:cut). There are missing genotypes (in addition to 104 and 112):

|    env    | gen | count |
|:---------:|:---:|:-----:|
| ID_2018_3 | 202 |   9   |
| WA_2019_2 | 201 |   10  |
| ID_2018_3 | 201 |   3   |
| OR_2018_2 | 201 |   12  |
| OR_2018_3 | 201 |   10  |

OR_2018_2 with 12 measurements of 201 and OR_2018_3 with 11 measurements of 201 were fixed trasnfering one value from OR_2018_2 to OR_2018_3.

Multienvironment trial dataset is composed by three locations, two years, and 3, 4, or 5 cuts (samplings):

| factor | count |
|:------:|:-----:|
|   cut  | 3,4,5 |
|  year  |   2   |
|   loc  |   3   |
|   env  |   22  |

Cuts haverst) depended of the year and location. During 2018 the field was established and only three cuts were done.

Table S10. Harvest interval by year and location. Three-cut system was applied in 2018 in all locations. Four-cut system was applied in ID 2019 and in OR 2019. Five-cut system was applied in WA in 2019.

| Year  |    ID   |    OR   |     WA    |
|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|
|  2018 | 1,2,3,− | 1,2,3,− | 1,2,3,−,− |
|  2019 | 1,2,3,4 | 1,2,3,4 | 1,2,3,4,5 |

17 quality traits were collected. There are env where some traits were not collected:

| num |   Trait  | 2018_1 | 2018_2 | 2018_3 | 2019_1 | 2019_2 | 2019_3 | 2019_4 | 2019_5 |

## Flowchart and data analysis process:

- Generate BLUP values ST0.

- Generate BLUP values ST1.

- Basic statistical metrics.

- ANOVA to check sources of variation.
